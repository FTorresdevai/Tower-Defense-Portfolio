# 🏰 Tower Defense Game

A strategic Tower Defense game developed in **Java**, designed to demonstrate robust software architecture, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, and Design Patterns.

> **Note:** This project was developed as part of a Software Engineering curriculum, focusing on clean code and maintainability.

## 🎮 Game Description
The goal is to defend your base from waves of incoming enemies by strategically placing defensive towers. Each enemy eliminated grants coins, which can be used to buy more towers or upgrade existing ones.

### Key Features
* **Multiple Enemy Types:** Enemies with different speeds and health points.
* **Strategic Tower Placement:** Various towers with unique ranges and damage types.
* **Wave System:** Progressively difficult waves of enemies.
* **Interactive GUI:** Visual interface for gameplay and menus.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Patterns
This project follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern to ensure separation of concerns.

Significant **Design Patterns** applied:
* **Strategy Pattern:** Used to define different movement strategies for enemies and attack behaviors for towers.
* **Factory Pattern:** Implemented to facilitate the creation of different types of enemies and towers without coupling the code to specific classes.
* **State Pattern:** Manages the different states of the game (Menu, Playing, Game Over, Pause).
* **Observer Pattern:** Updates the GUI in real-time based on changes in the game model.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java
* **Build Tool:** Gradle / Maven
* **Testing:** JUnit, Mockito (Unit & Property-based testing)
* **GUI:** Lanterna (Text-based GUI) / Swing
